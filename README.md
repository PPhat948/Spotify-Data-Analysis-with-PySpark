# Spotify Data Analysis with PySpark

This project analyzes Spotify track and artist datasets using **PySpark** for data processing.  
It covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models to predict:

- **Track Popularity (Regression):** Achieved **RMSE ~10.04** and **RÂ² ~0.78**.  
- **Explicit Content (Classification):** Achieved **~94% Accuracy** with strong precision and recall.

The notebook `project_spotify.ipynb` contains the full workflow:  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Visualization and exploration of audio features  
- Regression model for predicting popularity  
- Classification model for detecting explicit content  

The accompanying PDF report (`Spotify data.pdf`) summarizes the pipeline, visualizations, and results.
